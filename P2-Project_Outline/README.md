## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The project is a translator app. What it does is allows communication between people who do not speak or understand English and those who do. It could be in a hospital, court or even bank. The hospital, bank or court admins will be able to log into the app and see the users, what languages they speak, how much they charge and how to contact them. Whne their services are needed the admins can initiate the communication.
The idea came about when my friend's friend who works at a local hospital told him how difficult it was for them to get translators during surgery.
